## How It Started

In my sophomore year of high school, I took an introductory course into programming. The class taught the basics of programming using Python, then we learned Java, and a bit of website development. The class was not what I expected from a programming course but it got me interested in programming. I took the follow up AP programming class and as I became more capable with my programming skills, I realized that I could get into the field of software engineering. From then on, I honed my skills in Java, picked up C and C++, and am now learning the ropes of Javascript.

## Keeping Me Interested

Some of the reasons I got into software engineering are robotics, video game development, and machine learning. In high school, I was on my schoolâ€™s robotics team and I was a part of the programming sub team. Our crew had to work together to program a robot to move around and complete tasks. From this, I got really interested in robotics and making machines. Creating robots and having them do cool things is an amazing experience. I am also interested in video game development because as a kid, I played a ton of video games. Video game development was a major selling point for me to get into software engineering because I get to create projects that are actually fun and interactive. Machine learning is a higher end concept that I would like to learn more about. The idea of AIs being able to learn how to do something sounds crazy and I want to know all about it. The practical uses for machine learning systems are widespread and I am interested in seeing how far it can advance. 

## Room To Grow

In this class, I hope to learn more about Javascript and be confident enough to say that I know how to use Javascript well. I also want to create a well developed professional persona with many projects and essays that can describe my experiences. As a software engineer, I want to gain more real world experience in the field. Learning about what it takes to have a job in software engineering gives me a goal to reach and even exceed.
