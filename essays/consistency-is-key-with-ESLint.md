## My First Time Hanging Out with ESLint

ESLint is a javascript coding standard that makes a program’s code have consistency and quality assurance. For ICS 314, we are using ESLint to keep our code easy to read for grading, and for practice in a professional development environment. After using ESLint for a week, I can say that it is very useful for keeping code neat. I realized that ESLint is strict with putting spacing between certain things and making sure there are no unused functions or variables. This helps to keep code visually clean and efficient with no unused things taking up space. I did not find it too hard to conform to ESLint’s standards, however there were some coding styles that I used that ESLint was not happy with. One of them was putting open brackets on a new line for functions. In ESLint, the open bracket stays on the same line as the function name with a space between it and the parentheses. Other than a few things like that, the style in which I code is similar to the standards of ESLint. 

## The Perks of Standardization

As mentioned before, ESLint is useful for standardizing code and checking for any mistakes. In the professional world, this is important because collaborative work is a massive part of being a software engineer. Ensuring code quality makes a program consistent so no matter how many people are working on it, the final product looks like it was written by a single person. Having a coding standard also allows someone to be able to jump into the middle of a project and be able to predict how the code will look. Since ESLint also checks for mistakes, it is a good tool for helping someone learn javascript. An example of how it has helped me was by enforcing the different uses of let and const when declaring a variable. ESLint enforces variables that do not change to be declared as const. As such, it helped me better understand the uses for const. 

## How To Know Which Coding Standard To Use

In the world of programming, there are many coding standards that exist to ensure code quality. They all have their little things here and there but the overall goal for coding standards is the same, make code consistent. With so many different options out there it begs the question, which one should I choose? I believe the answer mostly comes down to the preference of whoever is assigning the coding standard. There can be other factors such as how easy it is to implement or whether or not the IDE supports that coding style. However, if there are multiple options to choose from, it simply depends on what you, your peers, or your higher ups want to read. Having a coding standard is immensely important for writing code, but it is a free range on which one you choose or is assigned to you.
