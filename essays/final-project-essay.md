## Alone No Longer

The online video game space is vast and you can meet many new people from all across the world. However, it can be difficult to find reliable teammates online because people come and go all the time. Our solution to this problem is creating a connected hub of UH students where they can share what games they play and whether they play casually or competitvely. Then, other users can search for people that play the same games as them and teamup with those people or have someone to discuss their game with. This solution allows students at UH to meet new people and be able to find new teammates for whatever game they play. 

## Mockup Page Ideas

The navbar would include a home button, a filter for casual or competitive, and a login/ register dropdown. Within the casual and competitive pages, there would be an additional search filter so users can search for a specific game. The page would be populated with cards that show information about another user. It would show their name, username, email, what games they play, whether they play that game casually or competitively, and the amount of recomendations that user has. This information is collected when a user creates their profile 

## Use Case Ideas

New users will go to the landing page which provides an introduction to the site. This page will also have the options to either login or register a new account. New users are able to browse the “Casual” and “Competitive” tabs, but must register for an account in order to post their own profile or view users’ emails.

Users who decide to create an account will be able to do so by clicking on the “Register” prompt on the NavBar or on the landing page. This will bring them to a form that they must fill out, which asks for their first and last name, a username, their email address, which games they play, whether they play casually or competitively, and a password.

Returning users may login via the NavBar or the Landing page, as both “Login” buttons will link to the same login form. Once logged in, a user can browse through other profiles, edit or delete their own profile, recommend other players, or logout.

When an admin logs in, they are able to choose the same NavBar menus as a regular user, but there will also be an option to display every user without filtering between “Casual” and “Competitive.” Admins are also given prompts to edit or delete accounts.

## Beyond the Basics

For the website, we also want to include a recomendation system. Users are able to leave a recommendation for other users if they think the other person was a good teammate. To do this, we want to add a button on the cards of user's profiles that says "Recommend this user." When you click the button, it adds to that user's "score." This score will be shown to other users so they can see if other people think that person was a good teammate. A user can only recommend someone once so the system is not abused.
