## The Rainbow (Warrior) Connection
<img class="ui image" src="../images/rwclanding.png">
For our final project in ICS 314, I worked in a team to create the [Rainbow Warrior Connection](http://159.89.232.121/#/). The purpose of the website is to bring computer science and software engineering students from UH Manoa together with companies from around the US in a central hub.

On the website, students can create profiles and share information about themselves and what interests they have for a job. Companies are also able to create profiles where they can share descriptions about their company and post job listings. These profiles are then put on the "Browse Students" and "Browse Companies" pages where people can look through the existing profiles of other students or companies.
