The AP Computer Science Principles exam has two parts to it. The first part assesses your knowledge of overall concepts in computer science and understanding of computational thinking. The second part has the student develop a computer program of their choice and analyze that program. For the second part of the exam, I created a video game titled “Who Let The Dogs Out?”. The gameplay consisted of a kid trying to round up dogs by shooting nets at them. It sounds cruel, but that was the only way for that one kid to get all of the dogs. If a dog escapes by reaching the edge of the screen, it is game over. As for the analysis of the program, I was asked to describe certain aspects of the program’s code such as what does the program do, how does the program take inputs, how does the program use arrays, functions, loops, and so on. I developed the game using a Java IDE called Greenfoot. Since there were no specifications on how the program should be made, I went with Greenfoot because I had been introduced to it the year before and was comfortable using it.

This project was my first experience at having total control of what program I wanted to create. Being given full reign of my project seemed nice, however I was lost trying to think of what I even wanted to do. To get over this, I started with a basic layout of a game then added more to it when I thought of something I wanted to do. Just putting something down helped me get more creative with my thinking and come up with fresh ideas. This strategy of laying out a basic format then adding more has helped me throughout my academic career and it will continue to be a valuable skill.
